radix-tree-project
==================

This is an academic project to compare the efficiency of Red-Black Trees and Radix Trees when used to implement a dictionary.

The program reads in a list of words from a file, then times how long it takes to insert, search, and delete all of the words from each data structure.

This code was written for COMP 4420 Advanced Design and Analysis of Algorithms at the University of Manitoba.
